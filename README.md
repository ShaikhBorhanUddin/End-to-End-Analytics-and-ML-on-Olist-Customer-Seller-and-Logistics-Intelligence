ðŸ”¹ 1. Predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Why it matters: Businesses want to know which customers are worth investing in (discounts, loyalty programs, retention campaigns).

Target: Total revenue from a customer over their entire observed history (regression).

Features (SQL aggregates):

Number of orders placed

Average order value

Average review score

Customerâ€™s region/state

Time since first purchase

Total order value

Number of installments (if applicable)

Customer state

Product category mix in the order

ðŸ”¹ 3. Estimate Shipping Cost (Freight Value Prediction)

Why it matters: Olist pays attention to freight costs â€” predicting them can help set better shipping fees and optimize logistics.

Target: freight_value (continuous, regression).

Features (SQL joins):

Order weight & volume (from product dimensions)

Distance proxy (seller_state vs customer_state)

Number of items in order

Delivery time window

ðŸ”¹ 4. Predict Customer Review Sentiment (Positive/Negative)

Why it matters: Monitoring customer satisfaction and flagging potential complaints.

Target: Binary sentiment (e.g., review_score â‰¥ 4 = positive, â‰¤ 2 = negative).

Features (SQL joins):

Delivery delays

Number of items in order

Product category

Seller past performance (avg review score)

Features (SQL joins):

Product category

Order value

Delivery time

Customer history (first order vs repeat buyer)
